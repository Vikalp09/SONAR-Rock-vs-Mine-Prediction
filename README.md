# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
Welcome to the SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction project! This repository contains a Python application that uses machine learning to predict whether an object in the ocean is a rock or a mine based on SONAR signals. This project aims to enhance underwater object detection using advanced classification techniques.
